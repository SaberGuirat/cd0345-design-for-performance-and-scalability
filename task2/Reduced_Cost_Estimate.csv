Changes Made : since we don't want to affect performance and based on this AWS documentation https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/running-web-applications-on-amazon-ec2-spot-instances/ i decided to lower ec2 instances costs by using ec2 spot over on demand which add more flexibility and doesn't need any form of contract with aws as solution than using reserved instances or computing saving plan .
